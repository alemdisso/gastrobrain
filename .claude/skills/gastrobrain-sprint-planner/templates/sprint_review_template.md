### [Sprint Number] - [Sprint Theme]

**Sprint Duration:** [Start Date] - [End Date], [Year]
**Calendar Days:** [X]
**Active Working Days:** [X] ([XX]% utilization)
**Planned Issues:** [X] ([XX] points)
**Completed Issues:** [X] ([X planned + X unplanned]; [any deferred/resolved notes])

#### Estimation vs Actual

| Issue | Title | Type | Est Points | Weighted Actual | Lines | Ratio | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------|------------|-----------------|-------|-------|------------|
| #XXX | [Issue title] | [Type] | X | X.XX* | XXXX | X.XXx | [⚡ Faster / ✅ On target / 🔴 Over / 📋 Unplanned] |
| #XXX | [Issue title] | [Type] | X | X.XX* | XXXX | X.XXx | [Assessment] |
| **TOTAL** | | | **XX** | **X.XX** | **XXXXX** | **X.XXx** | |

*\* Weighted by lines changed when sharing day with other issues*
<!-- Add additional footnotes as needed for hidden overhead, deferred issues, etc. -->

#### Accuracy by Type (Weighted)

| Type | Issues | Est Total | Weighted Actual | Avg Ratio | Verdict |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| [Type 1] | #XXX, #XXX | X | X.XX | X.XXx | [⚡/✅/🔴 + brief verdict] |
| [Type 2] | #XXX | X | X.XX | X.XXx | [Verdict] |

**Overall:** [1-2 sentence summary of estimation accuracy with ratio and context]
<!-- REMINDER: Balance overestimation vs efficiency — fast execution can be both; acknowledge genuine skill gains -->

#### Variance Analysis

<!-- Group issues by outcome: Major Overruns, Major Underruns, On Target, Unplanned, Deferred -->
<!-- For each notable issue, explain: -->
<!--   1. What was estimated vs actual -->
<!--   2. Root cause of the variance -->
<!--   3. Lesson learned (actionable, not just "we were wrong") -->

**Major Overruns:**

**#XXX ([Issue title])** - Estimated: X points -> Actual: X.XX days (X.XXx)
- Root cause: [What caused the overrun]
- [Additional context from developer interview]
- Lesson: [Actionable takeaway for future estimation]

**Faster Than Expected:**

**#XXX ([Issue title])** - Estimated: X points -> Actual: X.XX days (X.XXx)
- Root cause: [What enabled fast execution]
<!-- REMINDER: Distinguish genuine efficiency (pattern reuse, skill gains, good preparation) from overestimation (new work type, no calibration data) -->
- Lesson: [Actionable takeaway]

**On Target:**

**#XXX ([Issue title])** - Estimated: X points -> Actual: X.XX days (X.XXx)
- [Why this was accurately estimated]
- Lesson: [What made this estimate reliable]

**Unplanned Work:**

**#XXX ([Issue title])** - Unplanned -> Actual: X.XX days
- [Context: UX feedback? Bug discovery? Scope evolution?]
<!-- REMINDER: Frame emergent work contextually — UX feedback is a healthy product cycle, not just "unplanned work" -->
- Lesson: [Actionable takeaway]

#### Working Pattern Observations

```
[Date]:  [Activity bars] #XXX ([lines]), #XXX ([lines])
[Date]:  [Activity bars] #XXX ([lines])
[Date]:  - (no commits / rest day)
...
```

**Patterns:**
- [Pattern 1 observed in commit timeline]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]
- [Pattern 4]

#### Lessons Learned

<!-- Typically 5-8 lessons. Each should have: -->
<!--   - Bold header summarizing the lesson -->
<!--   - Supporting data points -->
<!--   - Actionable takeaway (not just observation) -->
<!-- REMINDER: Balance fast execution framing — credit genuine efficiency, don't attribute all speed to "bad estimates" -->
