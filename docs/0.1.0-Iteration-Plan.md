# 0.1.0 Milestone - Iteration Plan

**Goal**: Personal Meal Planning Excellence - Remove daily friction while building modern development foundations.

**Philosophy**: Distribute testing throughout development to avoid testing debt and maintain quality-first development rhythm.

---

## üìä **Overview**

- **Total Issues**: 20 in milestone
- **Estimated Timeline**: ~15-20 days
- **Approach**: Fix critical issues first, build foundations incrementally, add high-value features
- **Testing Strategy**: Integrate testing infrastructure throughout iterations, not as separate phase

### **ITERATION 3: Foundation + Automation (3-4 days)**

#### Issues

5. **#144 - Implement Database Migration Strategy** `P1-High` `architecture`
   - **Impact**: Enables safe schema evolution, critical for data integrity
   - **Effort**: ~1-2 days (framework + first migration)
   - **Deliverables**: Migration runner, version tracking, backup system
   - **Priority**: Blocks other data improvements

6. **#44 - Implement GitHub Actions CI** ‚úì‚úì `testing`
   - **Impact**: Automated quality assurance, prevents regressions
   - **Effort**: ~1 day (CI pipeline setup)
   - **Synergy**: Automates the testing framework built in previous iterations

#### **Focus:**

- Build sustainable development infrastructure
- Automate quality checks
- Enable safe database evolution

#### **Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Database migration system operational
- [ ] Automated testing runs on every commit
- [ ] Data backup/restore capabilities implemented
- [ ] CI pipeline catches regressions automatically

---

### **ITERATION 4: High-Value Features + Test Coverage (3-4 days)**

#### Issues

7. **#5 - Add Shopping List Generation** ‚úì `P1-High`
   - **Impact**: Major workflow improvement, frequently requested
   - **Effort**: ~2-3 days (ingredient aggregation + UI)
   - **User Value**: Transforms meal planning workflow

8. **Test Coverage for Shopping List**
   - **Impact**: Ensures reliability of new major feature
   - **Effort**: ~1 day (using established testing patterns)
   - **Approach**: Unit tests for aggregation logic, widget tests for UI

#### **Focus:**

- Add major user-requested feature
- Demonstrate mature testing practices on new features
- High utility addition to daily workflow

#### **Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Shopping lists generate from meal plans
- [ ] Shopping list UI is intuitive and functional
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new feature
- [ ] Integration with existing meal planning workflow

---

### **ITERATION 5: State Management + Cache Issues (3-4 days)**

#### Issues

9. **#6 - Implement Proper State Management** ‚úì `P1-High` `architecture`
   - **Impact**: Addresses root cause of many UI consistency issues
   - **Effort**: ~2-3 days (Provider/Riverpod implementation)
   - **Foundation**: Enables reactive UI updates

10. **#120 - Recipe statistics not updating for side dishes** ‚úò `P0-Critical`
    - **Impact**: Fixes confusing UI state in cooking workflow
    - **Effort**: ~1 hour (should be much easier with proper state management)
    - **Synergy**: Demonstrates value of state management investment

#### **Focus:**

- Implement systematic solution to UI consistency issues
- Fix cache invalidation problems systematically
- Modern Flutter development patterns

#### **Success Criteria:**

- [ ] State management system implemented (Provider/Riverpod)
- [ ] Recipe statistics update immediately across all screens
- [ ] UI consistency maintained without manual cache management
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

- **#89 - Retroactive meal planning** ‚úì‚úì `UI` (advanced feature)
- **#133 - Streamline side dish workflow** ‚úì‚úì `UX` (optimization)

### **Important but Can Be Deferred:**

- **#145 - Convert to localized enums** ‚úì `i18n` (important for i18n)
- **#122 - Refine ingredient dialog UI** ‚úì‚úì `UI` (wait until #142 fixed)
- **#138 - Standardize filtering patterns** ‚úì‚úì `UI` (consistency)
- **#140 - Improve recipe card icons** ‚úì‚úì `UI` (polish)
