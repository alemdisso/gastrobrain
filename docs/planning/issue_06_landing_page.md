# Issue 6: Create/Polish Landing Page

## Prompt for Agent

Create a GitHub issue to design and implement (or polish if exists) the app's landing page.

**Context:**
- Landing page is first impression for new users
- Critical for feature discoverability
- Should embody Gastrobrain's personality strongly
- May already exist (issue #134 in 0.2.0) - if so, polish it; if not, create it
- Prepares for beta user onboarding

**Issue Requirements:**
- Title: "Create/Polish App Landing Page"
- Labels: `enhancement`, `UI`, `UX`, `P2-Medium`
- Milestone: `0.1.7 - Visual Foundations & Polish`
- Depends on: Issue #3 (ThemeData Implementation)
- Related: Issue #134 (0.2.0 milestone)

**Issue Description Should Include:**

1. **Objective**: Create (or polish) welcoming landing page that showcases Gastrobrain's personality and guides users to key features

2. **Tasks**:
   - Determine if landing page exists (check issue #134)
   - If exists: Apply design tokens and visual polish
   - If not exists: Design and implement landing page
   - Key content sections:
     * Welcome/hero area with app identity
     * Quick access to main features (recipes, planning, etc.)
     * Visual elements that convey food culture focus
     * Clear navigation to getting started
   - Apply established visual identity strongly
   - Consider first-time user experience
   - Ensure responsive design

3. **Design Considerations**:
   - Should be the strongest expression of Gastrobrain's visual personality
   - Warm, inviting, culturally grounded
   - Clear feature hierarchy
   - Not cluttered or overwhelming
   - Appropriate use of imagery (food, cultural elements)

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Landing page reflects Gastrobrain's personality clearly
   - Intuitive navigation to key features
   - Follows design tokens consistently
   - Engaging first impression for beta users
   - Works well on different screen sizes
   - All tests passing

5. **Deliverable**:
   - Landing page implementation
   - Screenshots of landing page
   - All tests passing
   - Documentation of approach for future reference
