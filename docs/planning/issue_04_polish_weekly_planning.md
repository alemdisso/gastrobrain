# Issue 4: Polish Weekly Meal Planning Screen

## Prompt for Agent

Create a GitHub issue to apply visual polish to the weekly meal planning screen.

**Context:**
- This is the main screen of the app
- Currently functional but lacks visual consistency and personality
- Should be the showcase of Gastrobrain's visual identity
- Apply design tokens and patterns from Issues #1-3

**Issue Requirements:**
- Title: "Polish Weekly Meal Planning Screen UI"
- Labels: `enhancement`, `UI`, `P1-High`
- Milestone: `0.1.7 - Visual Foundations & Polish`
- Depends on: Issue #3 (ThemeData Implementation)

**Issue Description Should Include:**

1. **Objective**: Transform weekly meal planning screen from functional to polished, applying established visual identity

2. **Current State Issues** (to be refined during implementation):
   - Inconsistent card background colors
   - Meal type badges feel heavy and inconsistent
   - Typography hierarchy could be stronger
   - Varying spacing between elements
   - Mixed visual styles (purple/lavender with grays/greens)
   - Overall feels like "functional prototype" rather than "product"

3. **Tasks**:
   - Apply design tokens to meal cards
   - Improve typography hierarchy (recipe titles, metadata, badges)
   - Refine spacing and visual balance
   - Standardize meal type badge styling (Almoço/Jantar)
   - Ensure color usage follows established palette
   - Polish empty states if needed
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Add subtle visual enhancements (appropriate use of shadows/elevation)

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Screen follows design tokens consistently
   - Visual hierarchy guides user attention appropriately
   - Meal cards have consistent, appealing styling
   - Screen reflects Gastrobrain's personality (cultured & flavorful)
   - All spacing follows spacing system
   - Typography uses defined scale
   - No hardcoded colors/sizes

5. **Deliverable**:
   - Updated weekly meal planning screen code
   - Screenshots/comparison showing before/after
   - All tests passing
   - Pattern documentation for meal card styling (for reuse)
